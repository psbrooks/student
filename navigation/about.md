### Culture, Family, and Fun

Everything for me, as for many others, revolves around family and faith.

- My family is pretty big as I have been married twice, my 1st wife passed away.  We have had 5 kids, 4 adopted by me, 1 biological.  Plus, there are three grandkids.  My name to my grandkids is Abuilito.
